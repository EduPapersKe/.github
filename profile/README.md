## Project: EduPapers
### Description<br>
This open educational resource platform aims to provide a centralized hub for educational materials such as notes, tests, and past papers for students of all levels, from primary and secondary schools to tertiary institutions. The platform allows users to sign up, access a wide range of resources, and download materials free of charge. One of the unique aspects of this platform is that users can contribute by uploading their own educational materials, fostering a collaborative environment where knowledge sharing is encouraged.<br>

### Problem Addressed<br>
Many students struggle to find quality learning resources, particularly notes, practice tests, and past papers. Traditional methods of acquiring these materials can be expensive, limited by geographical location, or simply unavailable.

### Solution Offered<br>
EduPapers provides a user-friendly platform for students from primary to tertiary institutions to:

 - Sign up for free access to a vast repository of educational resources.
 - Download any learning materials they need, including notes, tests, and past papers.
 - Contribute to the platform by uploading their own helpful resources in various formats.

### Open Source Approach
This project is built on the concept of open source. This means the platform's development is freely available for anyone to contribute to. This approach allows for:

 - **Community Collaboration:** Developers with web and mobile development skills can join the project to build a user-friendly interface accessible on various devices.
 - **Scalability and Sustainability:** The open-source model fosters a collaborative environment where the community can contribute to the platform's growth and maintenance.

### Project Aim & Goal
The primary aim of EduPapers is to democratize access to education by providing a free and centralized hub for educational resources. The long-term goal is to empower students by equipping them with the tools and materials needed to succeed academically.
